Instructions:

1. `git clone` and extract .py scripts to a directory
2.  Add your secrets (ideally stored in a secrets manager or password vault and shouldn't be hardcoded into the script) - maybe fork and enhance? Many thanks in advanced.
3. Modify the file path for the log output
4. Set a file watcher or configure your SIEM agent to collect from the file path.

Usage:

`./malwarebytes-get-events.py`
